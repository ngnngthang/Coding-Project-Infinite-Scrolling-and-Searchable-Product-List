# infinite_list_and_search

## Project Requirements
- You have been assigned a task to implement an infinite scrolling list of products in a Flutter **project**. The product data will be fetched from an API. Additionally, you need to provide a search functionality that allows users to search for products by name.

**Using this [product api](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products) to implement the infinite scrolling list for display list of products.**

- Acceptance Criteria
  1. Each time the user **scrolls to the end of the list, fetch the next 20 products**.
  2. **Display the list of products** with relevant information (e.g., name, price, image).
  3. Implement an **input for searching product name** (using */products/search?q* ). 
  4. Implement favorite feature for products.
    1. Favorite data should be stored in local DB or Google Firebase.
